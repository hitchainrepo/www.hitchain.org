                <h3>1.What is HitChain</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        HitChain is a blockchain technology based ‘self-governed’ community of global developers, which
                        is ‘By developers, Of developers, For developers’.
                    </p>
                    <P>
                        HitChain strives to build a decentralized and collaborative community to trade developers’ works
                        valued by a transparent credit system. It will be the first real community by developers, of
                        developers, for developers. The designated digital currency system encourages developer to
                        automatically redeem the real value with innovation and creativity, including the monetary
                        return (currency value) and privileges (currency right). The shared-governance system will
                        guarantee that each community member has the responsibility and right to participate in every
                        decision making in the community.
                    </P>

                <h3>2. What is HitChain Token (HIT)</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>HitChain Token (HIT) is a Ethereum ERC-20 based Token circulating within the HitChain ecosystem,
                        and will be used in the following scenarios</p>
                    <p>

                        a. To pay for HitChain regular business expenses including code hosting, copyright management,
                        crowdfunding reward, paid use and so on.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        b. To pay for to copyright transfer

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        c. Weighted Voting Rights and Voucher of Value Holding.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        d. When fuel tokens are not enough to pay, basic token is automatically converted into fuel
                        tokens to ensure the deal is completed.

                    </p>
                    <p>

                        It is important to note that before the launch of HitChain, the ERC-20 token - HIT based on
                        Ethereum will be used for rewards and operation promotion. Once HitChain online, ERC-20 will be
                        exchanged to HitChain Token (HIT) at one to one ratio.

                    </p>

                <h3>3. Who is leading the development of HitChain</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        HitChain founding team members are from well-known technology companies, open-source
                        organizations, and such as RedHat, Google, Apache Fund, Linux Fund and OSChina with strong
                        technical and operational background.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        One of HitChain's primary goals is to benefit global software developers. HitChain is committed
                        to addressing the most fundamental issue of fair and decentralized profit distribution. We
                        welcome all developers to join and build HitChain regardless of country or origin, skill level
                        and career goals.
                    </p>

                </article>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h3>4. What are the features of HitChain</h3>
                <article>

                    <p>
                        a. The world's largest software development collaboration platform One of HitChain's primary
                        goals is to benefit global software developers. HitChain is committed to addressing the most
                        fundamental issue of fair and decentralized profit distribution. We welcome all developers to
                        join and build HitChain regardless of country or origin, skill level and career goals.
                        Compared with GitHub and other open-source platforms focusing on getting job done, HitChain will
                        do more to formalize fair profit distribution platform to realize developers’ intrinsic value.
                    </p>
                    <p>

                        b. Products saved in decentralized form
                        At present, all major code hosting platforms for open-source projects around the world like
                        GitHub, are operated by a stand-alone entity, which is subject to technical failure and with
                        scalability issues and posting potential risk to over commercialization and monopoly.
                        <br/>
                        Instead HitChain will be a decentralized platform for software development and management to
                        solve the above problems with security, scalability, democracy, and autonomy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        c. Automatic Intellectual Property Protection
                        At present, the open-source communities manage development process and the results based on
                        version management system and issue tracking system, etc. Intellectual property rights such as
                        developer code and documentation are also confirmed by these systems. However, these systems are
                        not tamper resistant, and in some extreme cases the developer's originality may be maliciously
                        deprived of.
                        Instead as HitChain is a decentralized and shared development and storage platform, developers’
                        work will be safeguarded from any unauthorized direct use which can be spotted and stopped
                        instantaneously.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        d. Developer’s competency appraisal and credit system
                        In HitChain blockchain technology will be applied to establish an authoritative, recognized, and
                        transparent competency appraisal and credit system by collecting and managing developers’ data.
                        Such appraisal system will greatly reduce the collaboration and transaction cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        e. Tokenization of developers' works
                        Till today developers’ income is not matching to their contribution as they are kept at the
                        farthest end of the centralized value chain. Also, at the default of a widely accepted appraisal
                        and credit system, developers’ tech capability can’t be measured quantitatively and bring
                        matching monetary value.
                        HitChain’s solution is the digital currency protocol. Digital currency will be rewarded to
                        developers based on designated algorithm. Developers' workload and quality of work can be
                        directly assessed and converted into corresponding digital currencies by the pre-defined
                        triggers from either development stages or milestone (such as PR being accepted, Project
                        maturity, etc.), or public's attention (such as praise, fork, reuse, subscriptions, etc.).
                        Therefore, a transparent, open competency appraisal and credit system will be established in
                        HitChain and developer’s capability is measured precisely and will be converted to monetary
                        value.
                        Quite the opposite to existing highly centralized income distribution controlled by certain
                        entity, HitChain ensures fairness, accountability, autonomy, and justice by letting developers
                        transact and earn in algorithmic market freely.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        f. Transaction history is transparent and independent
                        In HitChain, supply and demand information are symmetrical. The price and transactions are open
                        and transparent. Dispute if any can be traced back and reconciled. HitChain’s transaction
                        settlement system is based on Blockchain technology jointly built by all participators.

                        Taking open-source development activities as an example, each open-source project can recruit
                        developers for support. Such transactions can be easily settled with HitChain digital currency
                        system without any third-party involvement with transparent pricing.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        g. Self – governed Community
                        HitChain is a platform maintained and updated by the all developers. All decisions needed for
                        community operation, such as development tool to provide, operation regulation, reward system
                        and transaction system will be made by members through public voting supervised by committee.
                        Each member’s voting power is different based on his competency appraisal and credit grade
                        calculated by underlining algorithm.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        To participate in the HIT distribution, you will need an Ethereum compatible wallet or an
                        application where you and only you hold the private keys. Private keys are needed to correctly
                        interact with smart contract functions, like transferring cryptographic tokens. Do not send
                        ether (“ETH”) directly from cryptocurrency exchanges, only an ETH compatible wallet.

                <h3>6. Why can’t Chinese, Korean, Singapore and U.S. citizens, residents or entities purchase HIT?</h3>
                <article>
                    <p>
                        It was decided that Chinese, Korean, Singapore and U.S. citizens, residents and entities should
                        be excluded from purchasing HIT in the token distribution because of some of the logistical
                        challenges associated with differing regulations above countries. HitChain Foundation does not
                        believe that the distribution of HIT or the HIT themselves are securities, commodities, swaps on
                        either securities or commodities, or similar financial instruments. The HIT are not designed for
                        investment or speculative purposes and should not be considered as a type of investment.
                        Nevertheless, citizens, residents and entities in above countries should not purchase or attempt
                        to purchase HIT.

                <article>
                    <p>
                        After the end of the Token Sale period (Token sale ends Feb 28) or after reaching the hard cap,
                        we will review the KYC information submitted, reconcile and audit payments received, calculate
                        tokens to be issued after rounding down, and target issuing the HIT and refunding any amounts
                        that must be refunded after the Token Sale.
